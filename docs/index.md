docker-alpine-python# docker-alpine-python
Overview
docker-alpine-python is a lightweight container boilerplate designed for Python development in a Dockerized environment. It uses Alpine Linux as the base image, ensuring a minimal and efficient setup. This project is ideal for developers looking to create Python applications with a small container footprint.

Features
Lightweight Base: Built on Alpine Linux for minimal size and resource usage.
Python Support: Includes Python and pip for application development.
Customizable: Easily extendable for various Python projects.
Docker-Compose Integration: Simplifies multi-container setups.
Volume Mapping: Supports live code editing with mapped volumes.
Prerequisites
Docker installed on your system.
Docker Compose installed (optional but recommended).
Basic knowledge of Python and Docker.
File Structure
Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ZotyaNET/docker-alpine-python.git
cd docker-alpine-python

6. Access the Application
The application will run based on the main.py file. Modify the file as needed, and changes will reflect in the container if using volume mapping.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZotyaNET/docker-alpine-python.git
cd docker-alpine-python

2. Add Your Python Code
Place your Python application files in the app/ directory. The main.py file serves as the entry point.


3. Define Dependencies
List your Python dependencies in app/requirements.txt. For example:

flask
requests

4. Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

docker build -t python-alpine-app .

5. Run the Container
Run the container using Docker:
docker run -v $(pwd)/app:/app python-alpine-app
Alternatively, use Docker Compose:
docker-compose up

Configuration
Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is pre-configured with:


Python installation.
Dependency installation from requirements.txt.
Entry point set to main.py.
You can customize it further to suit your project needs.


Docker Compose
The docker-compose.yml file simplifies container management. It maps the app/ directory to the container for live development.
Example main.py

print("Hello, Dockerized Python!")

Troubleshooting
Missing requirements.txt: Ensure the file exists in the app/ directory.
Permission Issues: Check file permissions for the app/ directory.
Dependency Errors: Verify the dependencies in requirements.txt are correct.
